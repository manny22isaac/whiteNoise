# whiteNoise

- Hello Again.
- Above (or below?) is the code for the noise oscillator. 
Written is a simple signal to a buffer no LFOs and no Waveshaping.
Do you think it's kinda boring? I think so. 
Lucky for you, since both of these oscillators (triangle) need more features and testing. 
There is more to look forward to... so until then have fun and stay tuned.
